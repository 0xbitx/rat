#### **Shell commands**
---
* running
  * Get data about all the running modules, what client it is running on & its identifying number.

* stream (client index)
* stream kill (client index | *)
  * To open a stream of a specific client, opening a window of the clients screen in a live feed.

* cam (client index) (camera number) (height,width)
* cam kill (client index | *)
  * To open a camera stream of the users live webcam, needing to know what webcam number you want to use & the size of the camera. With the help of the devices command this information is provided.

* audio (client index)
* audio kill (client index | *)
  * Listen to a clients microphone input live.

* keylogger (client index)
* keylogger kill (client index | *)
* keylogger text (client index)
* keylogger image (client index)
  * Log every key of a client with the option to write out these logs directly in the console or by creating an black & white image of the text.

* talk (client index)
* talk kill (client index | *)
  * Talk directly with the client, in combination with the audio module you can create an audio conversation. 

* server (MS-dos command)
  * If you need to use your command prompt of your server, you can do it from within the program.

* archive (client username | -a)
  * Archive the data collected from a specific client or all clients with "-a" flag. This will remove the folder of either the single user or all users after them being archived.

* whoami (client index)
  * If you've not used whoami upon connect option you can do it manually, gathering vital system information & location data of a client.

* all (session command)
  * Sent a single command to every client & get everyones response. This will create a slight feeling of a botnet but it is slower & is executed in a linear fashion.

* list [-l] | ls [-l]
  * List all the connected clients, either with basic information or a long list of who this person is with the "-l" flag.

* session (client index)
  * Upon a session with a specific client, this will make more commands available without the "all" or "client" commands & be receptive to command prompt data responses. Note that this session will be timed out after 2 minutes of inactivity returning you back to the managing shell to be able to keep all the clients alive even when no data is being sent between the sockets. If this happens, you can just reconnect & proceed.

* client (client index) (session command)
  * Send a session command to a specific client without entering a session with this client.

* del (client index | *)
  * Delete one or more clients from your server, disconnecting them from you.

#### **Session commands**
---
* running

* stream [ip:port]
* stream kill (stream index)
  * Stream module along with all the other modules will allow you to specify a custom socket address to connect with, this is usefull if you're using port tunneling to make ports available without the need of port forwarding, otherwise if not specified it will automatically connect to the same module port & ip of the host.

* cam [ip:port] (camera number) (with,height)
* cam kill (cam index)
  * Cam module need the camera number, if you have 2 cameras if you want to use the second camera you will have to use number 1, else if the client only has one camera use 0. You will also have to specify the width & height of the camera, this is because of a bug in the cv2 module making it neccesary to save a video file of the camera stream. You can use the devices command to find out the camera number & its size.
